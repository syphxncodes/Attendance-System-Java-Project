This project is created to remove proxies in institutes by finding if the student is in the room ( coordinates will be set by the instructor ) or not which is done using geolocation and google maps API. The code is generated by a random function by the teacher, and all students and teachers have to login ( credentials are stored in the database ). 

# Instructions to run
* Considering SQL is installed, if not install from (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/). Open MySQL Command Client and pass these statements.
  ``` sql
  create database attendance_system;
  use attendance_system1;
  create table students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    attendance INT DEFAULT 0
  );
  insert into students (username, password, attendance)
  values ('student1', 'stud123', 1);
  create table teachers (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
  );
  insert into teachers (username, password)
  values ('teacher1', 'pass123');

* After sql, Open terminal and type( and also ur sql password that u set during installation ). Also, create your own user and password using the command given, just change the placeholder of "your_username" and "your_password" to whatever u require.
  ```bash
    mysql -u root -p
    create user 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
    grant all privileges attendance_system.* to 'your_username'@'localhost';
    flush privileges;
  ```

* After this, save all the files that are on github into 1 folder. Open the attendance_system2.java file, and change the line 45 and 46 to the specified username and password respectively.
* Then, open terminal and go to the directory with this folder. Then in terminal, type this command out:
  ```bash
    javac -cp ".;miglayout-swing-11.4.2.jar;flatlaf-3.5.2.jar;miglayout-core-11.4.2.jar;mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar;json-20240303.jar;flatlaf-extras-3.5.2.jar;flatlaf-fonts-roboto-2.137.jar;" 
    attendance_system2.java
  ```
  ```bash
  java -cp ".;miglayout-swing-11.4.2.jar;flatlaf-3.5.2.jar;miglayout-core-11.4.2.jar;mysql-connector-j-9.1.0.jar;json-20240303.jar;flatlaf-extras-3.5.2.jar;flatlaf-fonts-roboto-2.137.jar;" attendance_system2
  ```
  * Yes, that's it for running the code. Have a good day!
